For example, information, (e.g. a set of figures) may be displayed for the purpose of education or advertising (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G09</class-ref>), for enabling the result of a measurement to be known (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G01</class-ref>), for signalling the information to a distant point or for giving information which has been signalled from a distant point (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G08</class-ref>); the words used to describe the purpose depend on features which may be irrelevant to the form of the apparatus concerned - such features as the desired effect on the person who sees the display or whether the display is controlled from a remote point. Again, a device which responds to some change in a condition, e.g. in the pressure of a fluid, may be used, without modification of the device itself, to give information about the pressure (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G01L</class-ref>) or about some other condition connected with the pressure (another subclass of <class-ref scheme="cpc">G01</class-ref>, e.g. <class-ref scheme="cpc">G01K</class-ref> for temperature), to make a record of the pressure or of its occurrence (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G07C</class-ref>), to give an alarm (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G08B</class-ref>), or to control some other apparatus (<class-ref scheme="cpc">G05</class-ref>). The classification scheme is intended to enable things of a similar nature (as indicated above) to be classified together, and it is therefore particularly necessary for the real nature of any invention to be decided before it can be properly classified.</note-paragraph></note></notes-and-warnings></classification-item>
